'''Әдебиеттен Нобел жүлдесі''' – жыл сайын дүние жүзінің қандай да елінен болмасын шыққан авторға беріледі.

Бұл сыйлықты швед инженер-химигі, өнертапқыш және өнеркәсіп иесі [[Нобел, Алфред Бернхард|Алфред Нобел]] ұйымдастырды. Оның есімімен аталған бұл сыйлық дүниежүзінде ең танымал, сонымен бірге ең қатты сыналады деп айтылады. Сыйлыққа А. Нобелдің кескіні бейнеленген алтын медаль, диплом және ақшалай сыйлық беріледі. Ақшалай сыйлық Нобель фондының кірісіне байланысты. Нобелдің [[1895]] ж. [[қарашаның 27]] жазған өсиетхаты бойынша оның капиталы (алғашында 31 млн. швед кроны) акция, облигация, несиеге салынды. Осыдан түскен табыс бірдей бес бөлікке бөлінеді және физика, химия, физиология немесе медицина, әдебиет және бейбітшілікті нығайтуға бағытталған үздік жетістіктерге беріледі. 

Сыйлықты жыл сайын [[желтоқсанның 10]] [[Ісуіш]] патшасы [[Стокхолм]]да тапсырады. Нобел әдебиет сыйлығын алғаннан кейін лауреат жұмысының тақырыбы бойынша дәріс беруге міндетті. Негізінен әдебиет сыйлығы жазушыға жеке шығармасы үшін емес, әдебиеттің дамуына қосқан үлесі үшін беріледі.

1901 жылдан бері Әдебиеттен Нобел жүлдесі беріліп келеді. Содан бері 106 жазушы осы сыйлыққа ие болды.
