'''А́нглия''' (ағылш. England [ˈɪŋɡlənd]) — Ұлыбритания және Солтүстік Ирландия Құрама Патшалығының ең ірі және әкімшілік орны. Ұлыбритания аралында орналасқан (ағылш. mainland).Ұлыбританияның халқының 83 % Англияда тұрады.

[[927]] жылы Англия бірнеше жергілікті графстволардың бірігу нәтижесінде пайда болды. Өз атын V-VI ғасырда құрылған англ деген герман тайпасынан алады. Ал Англия астанасы Лондон [[Еуропалық одақ|Еуроодақтағы]] ең үлкен қала болып саналады.

Англия — қазіргі көптеген жақанды нәрселердің шыққан жері. Олар ішінде ағылшын тілі, Англикан шіркеуі, [[Парламент]] негіздері. Ол Өндіріс революциясының отаны болып саналады.

== Аты ==
Англия деген аты герман тайпаларының бірінен шыққан. Бұл тайпа 5-6 ғасырларда пайда болған. Ғалымдар оларды Ангелн түбегінен шыққан деп ойлайды. Бұл түбек қазіргі [[Дания]] және [[Алмания]] жерінде орналасқан.
[[File:Gaius Cornelius Tacitus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Тацит]]
Англдар туралы бірінші жазбаша құжаттар 98 жылы шыққан. Оны сол кездің тарих зерттеушісі Тацит өзінің «Алмания» деген кітабында жазған. Ал Ұлыбританиядағы англдар туралы бірінші рет 897 жылы жазған. Бұл мәлімет [[Оксфорд|Оксфордтың]] ағылшын тілі сөздігінде бар.

Өкінішке орай Англия деген сөзді жалпы Ұлыбританияға қолданылады. Бұл жай елдің басқа ұлттарын ренжітіп, көптеген қайшылықтарға алып келеді.

===Early history===
{{Main|Prehistoric Scotland}}
Repeated [[glacier|glaciation]]s, which covered the entire land-mass of modern Scotland,  destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the [[Mesolithic]] period. It is believed that the first post-glacial groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the [[ice sheet]] retreated after the [[last glacial period|last glaciation]].<ref>The earliest known evidence is a [[flint]] arrowhead from [[Islay]].

Groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of [[Skara Brae]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] of [[Orkney]] dates from this period. [[Neolithic]] habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Francis|title=Britain BC| publisher=HarperPerennial|location=London|year=2003|isbn=978-0007126934|pages=98–104 & 246–250}}</ref>

[[File:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Skara Brae]], a [[neolithic]] settlement, located in the [[Bay of Skaill]], [[Orkney]].]] The written [[protohistory]] of Scotland began with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire]] in southern and central Great Britain, when the Romans occupied what is now [[England]] and [[Wales]], administering it as a [[Roman province|province]] called ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]''. Roman invasions and occupations of southern Scotland were a series of brief interludes. 

In AD 83–84 the general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] defeated the [[Caledonians]] at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]], and [[Castra|Roman forts]] were briefly set along the [[Gask Ridge]] close to the [[Highland Boundary Fault|Highland line]] (only [[Cawdor (Roman Fort)|Cawdor]] near [[Inverness]] is known to have been constructed beyond that line).

(1960) ''The Antonine Wall''. Glasgow Archaeological Society.</ref> 

The extent of Roman military occupation of any significant part of northern Scotland was limited to a total of about 40 years, although their influence on the southern section of the country occupied by [[Brython]]ic tribes such as the [[Votadini]] and [[Damnonii]] would still have been considerable between the first and the fifth century.<ref name=snyder/> In the 400s, [[Gaels]] from Ireland established the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]].<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/scotland/western/article_1.shtml Dalriada: The Land of the First Scots]".

===Medieval period===
{{Main|Picts|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Scottish clan}}
The [[Kingdom of the Picts]] (based in [[Fortriu]] by the 6th century) was the state which eventually became known as "Alba" or "Scotland". The development of "Pictland", according to the historical model developed by [[Peter Heather]], was a natural response to Roman imperialism.<ref>Peter Heather, "State Formation in Europe in the First Millennium A.D.", in Barbara Crawford (ed.), ''Scotland in Dark Ages Europe'', (Aberdeen, 1994), pp. 47–63</ref> Another view places emphasis on the [[Battle of Dunnichen]], and the reign of [[Bridei III of the Picts|Bridei m. Beli]] (671–693), with another period of consolidation in the reign of [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus mac Fergusa]] (732–761).<ref>For instance, [[Alex Woolf]], "The Verturian Hegemony: a mirror in the North", in M. P. Brown & C. A. Farr, (eds.), ''Mercia: an Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe'', (Leicester, 2001), pp. 106–11.</ref> 

The Kingdom of the Picts as it was in the early 8th century, when [[Bede]] was writing, was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander]] (1107–1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cináed mac Ailpín]] (Kenneth MacAlpin).<ref name=Lynch_359>{{cite book|chapter=Kenneth mac Alpin|last=Brown|first=Dauvit|editor=M.

From a base of territory in eastern Scotland north of the [[River Forth]] and south of the [[River Oykel]], the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the [[Old English|English]]-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Galloway]] and [[Old Norse|Norse]]-speaking [[Caithness]]; by the end of the 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its [[Anglo-Scottish border|modern borders]]. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages. 

The impetus for this was the reign of [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] and the [[Davidian Revolution]]. [[Feudalism]], government reorganisation and the first legally defined towns (called [[burgh]]s) began in this period. These institutions and the immigration of French and Anglo-French knights and churchmen facilitated a process of cultural osmosis, whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom's original territory in the east became, like the newly acquired south-east, English-speaking, while the rest of the country retained the Gaelic language, apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, which remained under Norse rule until 1468.<ref>{{cite book|last=Withers|first=Charles, W.J.|title=Gaelic in Scotland, 1698–1981|publisher=John Donald|location=Edinburgh|year=1984|pages=16–41;|isbn=9780859760973|authorlink=Charles W.

[[File:Wfm wallace monument.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Wallace Monument]] commemorates [[William Wallace]], the 13th-century Scottish hero.]]
The death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in March 1286, followed by the death of his granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], broke the succession line of Scotland's kings. This led to the intervention of [[Edward I of England]], who manipulated this period of confusion to have himself recognised as feudal overlord of Scotland. Edward organised a process to identify the person with the best claim to the vacant crown, which became known as the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Great Cause]], and this resulted in the enthronement of [[John of Scotland|John Balliol]] as king. The Scots were resentful of Edward's meddling in their affairs and this relationship quickly broke down.  War ensued and King John was deposed by his overlord, who took personal control of Scotland. [[Andrew Moray]] and [[William Wallace]] initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in what became known as the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].

The nature of the struggle changed dramatically when [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick]], killed rival [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] on [[10th February]] [[1306]] at [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Dumfries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/dumfries/dumfries/ |title=Dumfries Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland |publisher=Undiscoveredscotland.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref> He was crowned  king (as Robert I) less than seven weeks after the killing. Robert I battled to win Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the English invaders piece by piece.  Victory at [[The Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 proved that the Scots had won their kingdom, but it took 14 more years and the production of the world's first documented [[declaration of independence]] the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320 to finally win legal recognition by the English.

However war with England was to continue for several decades after the death of Bruce, and a civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, [[David II of Scotland|David II's]] lack of an heir allowed his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] to come to the throne and establish the [[Stuart Dynasty]].<ref name=Barrow>{{cite book|authorlink=G.

Scotland's [[head of state]] is the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]], currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] (since 1952). The title ''Elizabeth II'' caused [[Elizabeth I of Scotland|controversy]] around the time of the queen's coronation, as there had never been an ''Elizabeth I'' in Scotland. A legal case, [[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]] (1953 SC 396), was taken to contest the right of the Queen to title herself ''Elizabeth II'' within Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of Article 1 of the Treaty of Union. 

The case was lost and it was decided that future British monarchs would be [[Monarchical ordinal|numbered]] according to either their English or Scottish predecessors, whichever number is higher.<ref>[[Winston Churchill]], House of Commons [[Hansard|Official Report]] cols 199-201, 15 April 1953</ref> Hence, any future King James would be styled [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James VIII]] (since the last Scottish King James was James VII (also James II of England, etc.)) whilst the next King Henry would be King [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry IX]] throughout the UK despite the fact that there have been no Scottish kings of the name.

Scotland has partial [[self-government]] within the United Kingdom as well as representation in the UK Parliament.

The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to Westminster by passing a [[Legislative Consent Motion]] if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered to be more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of [[public services]] compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. For instance, the costs of a [[university]] education, and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.<ref>BBC Scotland News Online "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4845260.stm Scotland begins pub smoking ban]", ''BBC Scotland News'', 2006-03-26.

For the [[Scottish Parliament]], there are 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]] and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there are 59 [[list of UK Parliamentary constituencies in Scotland|constituencies]]. The Scottish fire brigades and police forces are still based on the system of regions introduced in 1975.

===Scotland within the UK===
A policy of [[devolution]] had been advocated by the three main UK parties with varying enthusiasm during recent history. The late Labour leader [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] described the revival of a Scottish parliament as the "settled will of the Scottish people".<ref>Cavanagh, Michael (2001) ''[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/aspect/docs/aspectcampaigns.htm The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament]''.

In 2007, the Scottish Government established a "[[National Conversation]]" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, [[federation|federalism]], or a referendum on [[Scottish independence]] from the United Kingdom. In rejecting the last option, the three main opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament have proposed a separate [[Scottish Constitutional Commission]] to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7195800.stm Party people confront new realities]''.

==Law and criminal justice==
{{Main|Scots law}}
[[File:Parliament House, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|[[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, is the home of the [[Court of Session]].]]Scots law has a basis derived from [[Roman law]],<ref>"Tradition and Environment in a time of change", J. A. Lillie (1970).

Scots law provides for three types of [[Courts of Scotland|courts]] responsible for the administration of justice: [[Private law|civil]], [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Law of Arms|heraldic]]. The supreme civil court is the [[Court of Session]], although civil [[appeal (law)|appeals]] can be taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (or before 1 Oct 2009, the 
[[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]). The [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The [[Court of Session]] is  housed at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union [[Parliament of Scotland]] with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at Lawnmarket. The [[sheriff court]] is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most of the cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.<ref>[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp "Court Information"] www.scotcourts.gov.uk. Retrieved on 26 September 207.</ref> [[District Courts of Scotland|District courts]] were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. The [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] regulates heraldry.

For many decades the Scots legal system was unique for a period in being the only legal system without a [[parliament]].  This ended with the advent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] which legislates for Scotland.  Many features within the system have been preserved.  Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible [[verdict]]s: "[[guilt (law)|guilt]]y", "[[not guilty]]" and "''[[not proven]]''". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]] with no possibility of [[retrial]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1 The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict] www.timesonline.co.uk.

[[Manslaughter]], in [[England and Wales]], becomes [[culpable homicide]] in Scotland, and [[arson]] becomes wilful fireraising.  Procedure also differs.  Scots juries consist of fifteen, not twelve jurors as is more common in [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking countries]].

The civil legal system has however attracted much recent criticism from a senior Scottish Judge who referred to it as being "Victorian" and antiquated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Forsyth |first=John |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Senior-judge-hits-out-at.5250755.jp |title=Senior judge hits out at 'Victorian' Scots courts - The Scotsman |publisher=Thescotsman.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref>

===Geology and geomorphology===
{{Main|Geology of Scotland}}

[[File:2001-ScotlandHighlands-TheQuirang2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Quiraing|Quirang]] on the Island of [[Skye]], part of the [[Scottish Highlands]].]]

The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]] and the landscape is much affected by [[glaciation]]. From a [[geology|geological]] perspective the country has three main sub-divisions.

====Highlands and islands====

The [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]] which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian Orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]]. 

A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the [[British Isles]] are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands, divided into four main groups: [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]], and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of [[freshwater]] including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low lying dune pasture land.

====Central lowlands====

The [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are to be found. This area has also experienced intense [[volcanism]], [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|Arthur’s Seat]] in [[Edinburgh]] being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.

====Southern uplands====

The [[Southern Uplands]] are a range of hills almost {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usscotfax/geo/index.html |title=Scotfax: Geography of Scotland on Undiscovered Scotland |publisher=Undiscoveredscotland.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |title=Southern Uplands |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date=1990-11-16 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |title=Education Scotland - Standard Grade Bitesize Revision - Ask a Teacher - Geography - Physical - Question From PN |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref><ref name="Scotland Today » ITKT">{{cite web|url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |title=Scotland Today » ITKT |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref> The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 4–500 million years ago.

Because of their [[topography]] and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments, with mixed public feelings.<ref>The large number of military bases in Scotland has led some to use the euphemism "Fortress Scotland".

[[Scottish music]] is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the [[Great Highland Bagpipe]], a [[wind instrument]] consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. [[Pipe Band|Bagpipe band]]s, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The [[clàrsach]] (harp), [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]] and [[accordion]] are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in [[Scottish country dance]] bands. Today, there are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/2658-belle-sebastian-revealed-as-best-scottish-band-of-all-time/ | title=Best Scottish Band of All Time | publisher = The List |accessdate=2006-08-02}}</ref>

[[Scottish literature]] includes text written in [[English language|English]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Scots language|Scots]], [[French language|French]], and [[Latin language|Latin]]. The poet and songwriter [[Robert Burns]] wrote in the [[Scots language]], although much of his writing is also in English and in a "light" Scots dialect which is more accessible to a wider audience. Similarly, the writings of [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] were internationally successful during the 19th and early 20th Centuries.<ref name="Scotti">{{cite web | url=

[[J. M.

Rowling]] has become one of the most popular authors in the world (and one of the wealthiest) through her [[Harry Potter]] series, which she began writing from a coffee-shop in Edinburgh.

Scottish theatre has for many years played an important role in Scottish society, from the music hall variety of [[Sir Harry Lauder]] and his contemporaries to the more serious plays put on at the [[Citizens Theatre]] in Glasgow and many other theatres throughout Scotland.

The national broadcaster is [[BBC Scotland]] ([[BBC Alba]] in Gaelic), a constituent part of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], the publicly funded broadcaster of the United Kingdom. It runs two national [[Scottish television stations|television stations]] and the national radio stations, ''[[BBC Radio Scotland]]'' and ''[[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]]'', amongst others. The main Scottish commercial television station is [[STV]]. National [[List of Scottish newspapers|newspapers]] such as the [[Daily Record (Scotland)|''Daily Record'']], [[The Herald (Glasgow)|''The Herald'']], and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' are all produced in Scotland.<ref name="Newspapers">{{cite web | url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla68/papers/051-127e.pdf |format=PDF| title=Newspapers and National Identity in Scotland | publisher=IFLA University of Stirling | accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> Important regional dailies include the [[Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News]] in Edinburgh '''[[The Courier and Advertiser|The Courier]]'' in Dundee in the east, and ''[[Press and Journal (Scotland)|The Press and Journal]]'' serving Aberdeen and the north.<ref name="Newspapers"/> Scotland is represented at the [[Celtic Media Festival]], which showcases film and television from the Celtic countries.

As one of the [[Celtic nations]], Scotland and Scottish culture is represented at interceltic events at home and over the world. Scotland hosts several music festivals including [[Celtic Connections]] (Glasgow), and the [[Hebridean Celtic Festival]] (Stornoway). Festivals celebrating Celtic culture, such as [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient]] ([[Brittany]]), the [[Pan Celtic Festival]] (Ireland), and the National Celtic Festival ([[Portarlington, Victoria|Portarlington]], Australia), feature elements of Scottish culture such as language, music and dance.<ref name="Celtic nation 1">{{cite book

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Scotland}}
[[File:18th Green and Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Course at St Andrews]]]]
[[Sport in Scotland|Sport]] is an important element in Scottish culture, with the country hosting many of its own national sporting competitions. It enjoys independent representation at many international sporting events including the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[Rugby Union World Cup]], the [[Rugby League World Cup]], the [[Cricket World Cup]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]], but not at the [[Olympic Games]] where Scottish athletes are part of the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain team]]. Scotland has its own national [[sport governing body|governing bodies]], such as the [[Scottish Football Association]] (the second oldest national football association in the world)<ref>Soccer in South Asia: Empire, Nation, Diaspora. By James Mills, Paul Dimeo: Page 18 - Oldest Football Association is England's FA, then Scotland and third oldest is the Indian FA.</ref> and the [[Scottish Rugby Union]]. Variations of football have been played in Scotland for centuries with the earliest reference dating back to  1424.<ref name=FIFA>{{cite web | author=Gerhardt, W. | publisher=[[FIFA]] | publishyear= | url=http://www.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,1283,1,00.html | title=The colourful history of a fascinating game.

Scotland (and England) fielded the first international football team. Scottish clubs have been successful in European competitions with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] winning the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]] in 1967, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and  [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1972 and 1983 respectively, and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] also winning the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in 1983. The [[Fife]] town of [[St. Andrews]] is known internationally as the ''Home of [[Golf]]''<ref>Keay (1994) ''op cit'' page 839. "In 1834 the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club]] declared St. Andrews 'the Alma Mater of golf'".</ref> and to many golfers the [[Old Course at St Andrews|Old Course]], an ancient [[links (golf)|links]] course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage.<ref>Cochrane, Alistair (ed) ''Science and Golf IV: proceedings of the World Scientific Congress of Golf''. Page 849. Routledge.</ref> There are many other famous [[Golf in Scotland|golf courses in Scotland]], including [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]], [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]], [[Muirfield (Scotland)|Muirfield]] and [[Royal Troon]]. Other distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the [[Highland games]], [[curling]] and [[shinty]]. Scotland played host to the Commonwealth Games in [[1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970]] and [[1986 Commonwealth Games|1986]], and will do so again in [[2014 Commonwealth Games|2014]].

===National symbols===
{{Main|National symbols of Scotland}}

[[File:Onopordum acanthium Scotch Thistle.PNG|thumb|left|The [[thistle]], Scotland's [[Floral emblem]].]] The national [[flag of Scotland]], known as the Saltire or St. Andrew's Cross, dates (at least in legend) from the 9th century, and is thus the oldest national [[flag]] still in use. Since 1606 the Saltire has also formed part of the design of the [[Union Flag]]. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the [[thistle]], the nation's [[national emblem|floral emblem]], the 6 April 1320 statement of political independence the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], the textile pattern [[tartan]] that often signifies a particular [[Scottish clan]], and the [[Lion Rampant]] flag.<ref>"National identity" in M. Lynch (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'', (Oxford, 2001), pp. 437–444.</ref><ref>Keay, J. & Keay, J. (1994) ''Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland''. London. HarperCollins. Page 936.</ref><ref>[http://www.rampantscotland.com/symbols/blsymbols_index.htm "Symbols of Scotland—Index"] Rampant Scotland. Retrieved on 20 September 2007.</ref>

''[[Flower of Scotland]]'' is popularly held to be the [[National Anthem of Scotland]], and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Scotland national team. ''[[Scotland the Brave]]'' is used for the Scottish team at the [[Commonwealth Games]]. However, since devolution, more serious discussion of the issue has led to the use of ''Flower of Scotland'' being disputed. Other candidates include ''[[Highland Cathedral]]'', ''[[Scots Wha Hae]]'' and ''[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4036123.stm| title=Anthem demand falls on deaf ears| work=BBC Scotland News| date=2004-11-24| accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref>

[[St Andrew's Day]], 30 November, is the [[national day]], although [[Burns' Night]] tends to be more widely observed. [[Tartan Day]] is a recent innovation from [[Canada]]. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament passed the [[St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007]], designating the day to be an official [[bank holiday]].<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/en2007/2007en02.htm "Explanatory Notes to St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007"] Office of Public Sector Information.
