'''Dear uploader:''' This media file, which you just uploaded, '''has been listed for [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]]''' because you indicated that only Wikipedia has permission to use this file. While it might seem reasonable to assume that such files can be freely used on Wikipedia, since explicit permission to use it was given, this is in fact '''not''' the case. [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html] [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2007-February/027547.html] Please do not upload any more files with this restriction on them, because content on Wikipedia needs to be compatible with the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], which allows anyone to use it. See our [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free content guidelines]] for more information.

'''If you ''created'' this media file''' and want it to be kept on Wikipedia, remove this message and replace this with <nowiki>{{GFDL-self}}</nowiki> to license it under the [[GFDL]], or <nowiki>{{cc-by-sa-2.5}}</nowiki> to license it under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike license, or use <nowiki>{{PD-self}}</nowiki> to release it into the public domain.

'''If you ''did not create'' this media file''' but want it to be used on Wikipedia, there are two ways to proceed.  First, you may replace this message with one of the fair use tags from [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Tagging fair use images|this list]] if you believe one of those [[fair use]] rationales applies to this file.  Second, you may want to contact the copyright holder and [[Wikipedia:Example requests for permission|request that they make the media available under a free license]].

If you have any questions please ask them at the [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions|Media copyright questions page]]. Thank you.
