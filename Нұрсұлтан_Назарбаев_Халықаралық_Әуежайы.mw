'''Astana International Airport''' {{airport codes|TSE|UACC}} is an international airport in [[Kazakhstan]] located 14 km (9 mi) outside of the capital [[Astana]]. 

==History==
The airport traces its history to 1931 when Astana's first airfield was constructed. Airport infrastructure has been continuously upgraded, making it possible to accept heavy aircraft by 1948, and starting 24-hour operation in 1956.

Following the transfer of the country capital to Astana in 1997, the airport underwent a series of major reconstructions which brought it up to international standards. A new passenger terminal was officially opened in February 2005.
