The '''Spain national football team''' represents [[Spain]] in [[FIFA|international]] [[association football]] and is controlled by the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]], the governing body for [[football in Spain]]. The current head coach is Vicente del Bosque. The Spanish side is commonly referred to as '''La Furia Roja''' (The Red Fury) or '''La Roja''' (The Red One).<ref>http://www.juegalaroja.com/</ref><ref>http://www.notasdefutbol.com/seleccion-espanola/otro-junio-de-ilusion-todos-con-la-roja</ref>

Spain is currently the reigning World and European champion, having won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 UEFA European Football Championship]]. Spain also won the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]] and reached the [[UEFA Euro 1984 Final]]. In July 2008 Spain rose to the top of the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for the first time in the team's history, becoming the sixth nation to top this ranking, and the first nation to top the ranking without previously having won the World Cup. Between November 2006 and June 2009 Spain went undefeated for a record-tying 35 consecutive matches before their loss to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], a record shared with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], including a record 15-game winning streak and thus earning third place in the FIFA Confederations Cup. Recently, the team has become known for using a style of play which involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns, and sharp, one- or two-touch passing; this style of play has been dubbed [[Tiki-taka]] (or Tiqui-taca), which is also associated with [[FC Barcelona]].

==History==
===Early Years and the Effect of War===
The [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Real Federación Española de Fútbol]] ''(English: Royal Spanish Football Federation)'' was founded in 1909 and became affiliated with [[FIFA]] in 1913. However, the national team did not play a full international match until 1920 when they beat [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 1&ndash;0 in the Olympic Games. Their first appearance at a major finals was the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]], for which they [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualified]] after 9&ndash;0 and 2&ndash;1 wins over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. They beat [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3&ndash;1 in the first round, before losing 1&ndash;0 in a replay to hosts, and eventual champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Florence]]. On 3 May 1936 Spain beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 2&ndash;0 in [[Bern]], in what would prove to be their last game until after the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1941. They would then play only against similarly politically-aligned countries, or Switzerland, [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and Portugal, neutral during World War II until 1949 when they drew 1&ndash;1 with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and re-entered FIFA competition.

===The Post-Civil War National Team===
The [[Spanish Civil War]] and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifiers]], where they overcame Iberian rivals [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], who later declined an invitation to take part, with a 5&ndash;1 win and 2&ndash;2 draw. At the finals in Brazil, they topped their group against [[England national football team|England]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] to progress to the final round.

For the first, and so far only time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, the winner was decided, not by a single championship match, but via a group format involving the four teams who had won their respective groups in the previous stage.  The four teams in the final group were [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and Spain.  Spain failed to record a win (W0 D1 L2) and finished in fourth place.  Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals, which had given them the name of the "underachievers." Spain's leading scorer during the 1950 World Cup was striker [[Estanislao Basora]], who ended the tournament with five goals.

Under French-Argentine coach [[Helenio Herrera]] and Italian assistant coach Daniel Newlan, Spain came out of dormancy to qualify for the first [[1960 European Nations' Cup|European Championship]] in 1960. Spain beat [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 7&ndash;2 on aggregate to progress to the quarterfinals. However, Spain forfeited its quarterfinal tie with the Soviet Union because of political disagreements between Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and the Soviets.

The Spaniards, led by [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualified]] for the [[1962 World Cup]], beating [[Wales national football team|Wales]] 3&ndash;2 over two legs to advance to the [[UEFA]]/[[CAF]] play-off where they would beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 4&ndash;2 over two legs to advance to the finals.

===José Villalonga Era and the 1964 European champions===
In 1962, [[José Villalonga Llorente|José Villalonga]] was appointed coach of Spain. Under Villalonga, Spain qualified for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] but was eliminated in the first round group against Brazil, [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Two years later Spain hosted the [[1964 European Nations' Cup|European Championship]], in which the team beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] to move on to the semifinals. There they beat highly-favoured [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 2–1 after extra time. Spain went on to beat the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]] 2–1 before a crowd of more than 79,000 at [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|the Bernabéu]] in [[Madrid]]. [[Jesús María Pereda]] put Spain ahead after just six minutes, but [[Galimzian Khusainov]] equalised a few minutes later with a free kick. [[Marcelino Martínez]] put in a late header to win Spain's first major international title.

As European champions, Spain automatically qualified for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], retaining much of the same squad from 1964 and keeping José Villalonga at the helm. However, they failed to progress beyond the first round, defeating only [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and losing to [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].

The departure of Villalonga put Spain into another period of mixed results. After winning its group in the qualifying rounds of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|Euro 68]], the team was knocked out by [[England national football team|England]] in the quarterfinals and did not make it to the final tournament held in Italy. Spain did not qualify for another tournament until the [[1978 World Cup]].

===1982 World Cup in Spain===
In 1976, Spain was selected as host of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]. This edition of the World Cup featured 24 teams for the first time. Expectations were high for Spain as the host nation under coach [[José Santamaría]]. In the group stages, Spain was drawn into Group 5, in which they could only manage a 1–1 draw with [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in the finals' opening match, after which they had a 2–1 victory over [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], but were defeated 1–0 by [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. These results were enough to secure progress to the second round where they were drawn into Group B, but defeat to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and a goalless draw with [[England national football team|England]] meant that Spain were knocked out, and Santamaría was sacked.

===1984 to 1988===
Former Real Madrid coach [[Miguel Muñoz]], who had temporarily coached Spain in 1969, replaced by Daniel Newlan, returned to coach the national team. Spain was in [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 84]] qualifying Group 7, against [[Netherlands national football team|The Netherlands]], [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. Entering the last match, Spain needed to defeat Malta by at least 11 goals to surpass the Netherlands for the top spot in the group, and after leading 3–1 at half time, Spain scored nine goals in the second half to win by [[Spain vs Malta 1984 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying match|12–1]] and win the group. In the final tournament, Spain was drawn into group B with Romania, Portugal, and West Germany. After 1–1 draws against their first two opponents, Spain topped the group by virtue of a 1–0 victory against West Germany. The semifinals saw Spain and Denmark drawn at 1–1 after extra time, before Spain proceeded by virtue of winning the [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] 5–4 on penalties. Hosts and tournament favourites [[France national football team|France]] defeated Spain 2–0 in the final after a goalless first half.

Spain qualified for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico having topped Group 7 with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], and [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. Spain began the group stage by losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 1–0,  but progressed after beating [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] by 2–1 and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] by 3–0. Round 2 paired Spain with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], who they overcame 5–1 with [[Emilio Butragueño]] scoring four goals, but in the quarterfinals a 1–1 draw with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] ended with Belgium winning 5–4 on penalties.

Muñoz was retained as coach for [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 88]]. As in the several previous tournaments Spain qualified impressively in a group with [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Albania national football team|Albania]]. Spain were drawn into group A and began their tournament with a 3–2 victory over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], but were nevertheless knocked out in the group stage after losing 1–0 and 2–0 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] respectively.

===1990 to 1992===
For the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy, Spain had a new coach, [[Luis Suárez Miramontes]]. Having qualified from a group consisting of Republic of Ireland, Hungary, Northern Ireland, and Malta, Spain entered the competition on a good run of form, and after reaching the knock out stages through a 0–0 draw with Uruguay and wins over South Korea (3–1) and Belgium (2–1),  fell to a 2–1 defeat to Yugoslavia in the second round.

Newly appointed coach [[Vicente Miera]] failed to gain qualification for Spain for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]], after finishing third in a group behind France and Czechoslovakia. Vicente Miera did however lead Spain to the gold medal at the [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]<ref name="Olympics 1992-">Since 1992, squads for [[Football at the Summer Olympics]] have been restricted to three players over the age of 23. The achievements of such teams are not usually included in the statistics of the international team.</ref> in [[Barcelona]].

===Clemente's Reign from 1992 to 1998===
[[File:Javier Clemente 2.jpg||thumb|right|300px|[[Javier Clemente]] and the Spain team in a training session.]]
Javier Clemente was appointed as Spain's coach in 1992, and the qualification for the [[1994 World Cup]] was achieved with eight wins and one loss in twelve matches. In the final tournament Spain were in Group C in which they drew with Korea Republic 2–2 and 1–1 with Germany, before qualifying for the second round with a 3–1 victory over Bolivia. Spain continued through the second round with a 3–0 victory over Switzerland, but their tournament ended with a 2–1 defeat to Italy in the quarter-finals.

Spain qualified for [[Euro 96]] from a group consisting of Denmark, Belgium, Cyprus, Republic of Macedonia, and Armenia. In the final tournament Spain faced group matches against Bulgaria, France and Romania. With 1–1 draws against the first two opponents, and a 2–1 win over Romania, Spain confirmed their place in the quarter-finals, with a match with hosts England, which finished goalless and Spain eventually fell 4–2 in the shootout.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.thefa.com/euro2004/History/Postings/2003/01/36689.htm |title = TheFA.com – 1996 European Championship |accessdate = 2008-06-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In [[1998 FIFA World Cup|his second World Cup]] as Spain's coach, Clemente led his team undefeated through their qualifying group in which Yugoslavia and Czech Republic were the other contenders. Spain qualified with fourteen other European sides in the first ever thirty-two team World Cup, but were eliminated in the first round with four points after losing to Nigeria, drawing with Paraguay, and winning just one game, against Bulgaria.

===Euro 2000 and World Cup 2002===
After a 3–2 opening defeat to Cyprus in [[Euro 2000]] qualifying, Clemente was fired and [[José Antonio Camacho]] was appointed as coach. Spain won the rest of their games to qualify for the final tournament, where they were drawn into Group C.  A 1–0 defeat to [[Norway national football team|Norway]] was followed by victories over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] (2–1) and Yugoslavia (4–3), with Spain thus setting up a quarterfinal against 1998 World Cup champions, [[France national football team|France]], which was won 2–1 by France.  

The qualifying tournament for the [[2002 World Cup]] went as expected for Spain as Spain topped a group consisting of [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]. In the final tournament Spain won its three matches in group B, against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] (both by 3–1), and [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] (3–2). Spain beat [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on penalties in the second round, and faced co-hosts [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]] in the quarterfinals. Spain twice thought they had scored, but the efforts were disallowed, though video replays showed that both goals were valid and Korea was successful in the penalty shootout after a 0–0 draw.

===Euro 2004===
At [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] in Portugal, Spain was drawn into group A with hosts [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece]], behind whom they had finished second in qualifying. Spain defeated Russia 1–0 and drew 1–1 with Greece, but failed to get the draw they needed against Portugal to proceed to the knock out stages. [[Iñaki Sáez]] was sacked weeks later and replaced by [[Luis Aragonés]].

===Luis Aragonés era, 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008===
[[File:España Suecia inicio.jpg||thumb|right|200px|[[UEFA Euro 2008]] pre-match ceremonies involving [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and Spain.]]
Spain qualified for the [[2006 World Cup]] only after a play-off against Slovakia, as they had finished behind Serbia and Montenegro in Group 7, which also included Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Lithuania, and San Marino. In Group H of the German hosted finals, Spain won all their matches, and beat Ukraine 4–0, Tunisia 3–1 and [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] 1–0. However Spain fell 3–1 in the second round to [[France national football team|France]], with only the consolation of a share, with Brazil, of the 2006 FIFA Fair Play Award.

After being eliminated from the competition, Luis Aragonés came to the decision that the team was not physical or tough enough to be able to out-muscle opponents, they therefore opted to start concentrating on monopolising the ball and thus started to employ the [[tiki-taka]] - a style characterised by short passing and movement, working the ball through various channels, and maintaining possession. [[Raphael Honigstein]] describes it as "a significant upgrade of the [[Total Football|Dutch "total football"]], a system that relied on players changing positions."<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifaworldcup/blog/2010/07/why-spain-were-anything-but-boring.html Why Spain were anything but boring]</ref>

[[File:Spain Euro 08 celebration 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Spanish players celebrating their victory in Madrid.]]
Spain qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] at the top of [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group F|Qualifying Group F]] with 28 points out of a possible 36, and were [[UEFA Euro 2008 seeding|seeded]] 12th for the finals. They won all their games in [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group D|Group D]]: 4–1 against Russia, and 2–1 against both Sweden and defending champions Greece.

Reigning World Cup holders [[Italy national football team|Italy]] were the opponents in the [[Euro 2008#Quarter-finals|quarter final match]], and held Spain to a finished 0–0 draw resulting in a penalty shoot-out which Spain won 4–2. Spain met Russia again in the semi-final, again beating them, this time by 3-0.<ref>[http://euro2008.worldcupblog.org/euro-2008-game-previews/euro-2008-final-preview-germany-vs-spain.htmlEuro 2008 Final Preview: Germany vs Spain]</ref>

In the [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|final]], played in [[Vienna]]'s [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion]], Spain defeated [[Germany national football team|Germany]] 1–0, with a goal scored by [[Fernando Torres]] in the 33rd minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2008/7363545.stm|title=Germany 0–1 Spain|date=2008-06-29|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-08-20 | location=London}}</ref> This was Spain's first major title since the 1964 European Championship.  Spain were the top scoring team, with 12 goals, and [[David Villa]] finished as the top scorer with four goals; Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] Team of the Tournament.<ref>Spanish players named in the ''team of the tournament'' were: goalkeeper and captain [[Iker Casillas]], defenders [[Carles Puyol]], [[Carlos Marchena]], midfielders [[Xavi]], [[Cesc Fàbregas]], [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Marcos Senna]] and strikers [[David Villa]] and [[Fernando Torres]].</ref>

2008 saw [[David Villa]] score 12 goals in 15 games, breaking the Spanish record of 10 goals in one year held by [[Raúl González|Raúl]] since 1999.<ref>[http://www.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/seleccion/es/desarrollo/1185746.html Villa, mejor goleador de la selección en un año natural {{sp icon}}]</ref> On 11 February 2009, David Villa broke another Spanish record as his 36th-minute goal against England saw him become the first Spanish player to score in six consecutive games.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en/news/468/internationals/2009/02/12/1105433/spain-hotshot-david-villa-delighted-with-goal-against-england Spain Hotshot David Villa Delighted With Goal Against England]</ref>

Spain began its [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign with six successive wins, and went into the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] as one of the favourites. By the start of the tournament, Del Bosque's had ten consecutive wins, making him the first international manager to do so from his debut, breaking [[Joao Saldanha]]'s record, held since 1969, of nine consecutive wins with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].

Spain won all three of its matches at the group stage, the 5–0 win over New Zealand including a [[Fernando Torres]] [[hat-trick]] that is the earliest and fastest hat-trick in the tournament's history. With further wins over [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] (1–0) and {{nft|South Africa}} (2–0) they earned not only qualification for the semifinals, but also obtained the world record for 15 consecutive wins and tied the record of 35 consecutive unbeaten games (with {{nft|Brazil}}).  

On 24 June 2009, Spain's undefeated record ended when the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] beat Spain 2–0 in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] semi-finals which sent Spain to the third place match. This was Spain's first defeat since 2006. Spain defeated hosts {{nft|South Africa}} 3–2 after [[extra time]] in the 3rd-place playoff.<ref>[http://goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010confederations-cup/2009/06/28/1351793/spain-finish-third-in-confederations-cup-after-thrilling Spain Finish Third In Confederations Cup After Thrilling Finale Against South Africa]</ref>

On 9 September 2009, Spain secured its place at the [[2010 World Cup|2010 World Cup finals]] after beating [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] 3–0 in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=236527&cc=5739&league=FIFA.WORLDQ.UEFA|title=South Africa place secured|date=2009-09-09|work=ESPN|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref> Spain went on to record a perfect World Cup qualifying record with 10 wins out of 10 in Group 5, finishing with a 5–2 victory over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 14 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=236569&cc=5739|title=Perfect record intact|date=2009-10-14|work=ESPN|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref> The Spaniards entered the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] as second place in the world rankings.

[[File:Spain and Portugal match at the FIFA World Cup 2010-06-29 5.jpg|thumb|right|Spain take a corner against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Spain vs Portugal|Round of 16 match in the 2010 FIFA World Cup]].]]
''See Also: [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group H]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final]]''

The 2010 World Cup draw, which took place on 4 December 2009, placed Spain in [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]], alongside [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], and [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. Spain lost its first group stage match against Switzerland, 0–1. In their second match they defeated Honduras by 2 goals from [[David Villa]]. Their next match against Chile on 25 June was won 2–1. 
They advanced to the knock-out stage to defeat Portugal 1–0, reaching the quarter-finals, in which they defeated [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] 1-0, scoring off of a goal by [[David Villa]] who put the ball in the back of the net after  struck the ball off the post, reaching the last four for the first time since [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]. They then advanced to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] for the first time ever by defeating [[Germany national football team|Germany]] 1-0 via a headed goal from [[Carles Puyol]].

[[File:Casillas besando la Copa del Mundo de fútbol.jpg|thumb|right|Spanish players ([[Iker Casillas]], [[Juan Manuel Mata|Juan Mata]] and [[Javi Martínez]]) celebrate with the World Cup trophy.]]
In the second half of extra time during the World Cup final against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Andrés Iniesta]] scored a single goal from a pass given by [[Cesc Fabregas]], winning the World Cup for Spain for the first time in their history. In this match Spain received 5 yellow cards, while the "Oranje" received 9. Spain won the World Cup by only scoring 8 goals and conceding 2, which is the lowest by any World Cup winner in both cases. Also, they are the only team not to have conceded a goal in the last four games of the tournament. Spain are the only team that has won the World Cup title after losing its opening game. Spain are only the second team to win a World Cup outside their own continent, following [[Brazil national football team|Brazil's]] wins in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|Sweden]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|Japan]], which also makes Spain the first European team to win the World Cup outside of Europe. Spain and Brazil are also the only teams to never win the World Cup whilst hosting the event, Spain having been eliminated in the second round in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]]

The 2010 FIFA World Cup squad won the FIFA fair play award while some of its players also won awards.<ref name="2010fairplay">{{cite web|title=Forlan and Muller strike gold|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1272888/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> Goalkeeper Iker Casillas won the [[FIFA_World_Cup_awards#Golden_Glove|golden glove]] for only conceding two goals during the tournament. David Villa won the [[FIFA_World_Cup_awards#Golden_Ball|bronze ball]] and [[FIFA_World_Cup_awards#Golden_Boot|silver boot]] with a total of 5 goals and 1 assist.

==Uniform kit==
Spain's traditional kit is a red jersey with yellow trim accompanied by dark blue shorts and socks while their traditional away kit is a full white kit with red and yellow trim. The colour of the socks changed throughout the 1980s from black to the same colour as the blue short. Spain's kits have been made by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1982 until 1984), [[Le Coq Sportif]] (from 1984 until 1992) and again Adidas (since 1992).

Their current home kit designed by a team led by Daniel Newlan at [[Adidas]], is a lighter red than usual along with light blue shorts and red socks, similar to the older 2006 kit.<ref>[http://www.adidas.com/campaigns/football/content/products-detail.aspx?article=P47902&collection=federation#grid Royal Spanish Football Federation Home Jersey]</ref> A third kit is sometimes used and is usually blue with red and yellow trim (used currently as change kit). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish football federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the [[coat of arms of Spain]] over the left breast. After winning the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] a golden star was added at the top of the emblem.

==Competitive record==

:''*Denotes draws including knockout matches decided on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty kicks]].''
:''**Since [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], Spain has sent its under 23 national team.''

==Home stadium==
Spain does not have a national stadium as such, though major qualifying matches are usually played at the [[Estadio Santiago Bernabéu]] in [[Madrid]].  Other large grounds used include the [[Estadio Vicente Calderón]], also in Madrid, and the [[Mestalla]] in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].  Spain are unbeaten in competitive matches played at the Calderón.  Some international friendlies are played in these larger stadia, as well as the [[Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán]] in [[Seville]], which staged the 2009 friendly against [[England national football team|England]] after the visitors refused to play in Madrid following racist abuse of their black and mixed-race players and their national anthem at the Bernabéu in a 2004 friendly.

Other friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against less glamorous opponents are played in provincial stadia.  Ground recently used include the [[Riazor]] in [[La Coruña]], the [[Estadio Nueva Condomina]] in [[Murcia]], the [[Estadio Carlos Belmonte]] in [[Albacete]] and the [[Estadio Romano]] in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].  Occasionally, matches are played off mainland Spain; their final [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] match against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] was played at the [[Estadio Gran Canaria]] in [[Las Palmas]], on the [[Canary Islands]].
