== Өмірінің бастапқы кезеңі ==
Мұса Жәлил [[Оренбург губерниясы]]ндағы [[Мустафино]] ауылында ескі заттарды сатумен айналысатын кәсіпшінің отбасында дүниеге келді. Ол Орынбордағы [[Хұсайния]] медресесін бітірген. Алғашқы өлеңдері революция тақырыбына арналды. Жәлилдің ең алғашқы еңбектерінен түркі ақындық өнеріне тән «[[аруз]]» дәстүрінің әсерін байқауға болады. 1919 жылы ол сол кездері [[ақтар қозғалысы|ақтардың]] билігінде болған Орынбордың астыртын [[комсомол]] ұйымына мүше болды. Содан соң Жәлил [[Азамат соғысы (Ресей)|азамат соғысы]]на қатысты, бірақ жасы келмегендіктен майданда әскери қимылдарға қатысқан жоқ, ақтарды жақтайтын қарулы топтармен күресуге атсалысты. 1920 жылы Жәлил өзінің туған ауылына қайтып оралып, онда «Қызыл гүл» атты жас коммунист ұйымын ашты. Ол Мустафинода комсомол белсендісі болды. Губерниялық комсомол конференциясында өз ауылынан делегат болып барды.<ref name="mustafin">{{ru icon}} [http://www.kitap.net.ru/mustafin/2.php]</ref>

== Әдеби шығармашылығы ==
In 1920 the [[Tatar ASSR]]  was proclaimed and [[Kazan]] was established as its capital. In 1922 Musa as many other Tatar poets moved to Kazan. This early period of Cälil's life is co-called ''Red period'', mostly due to his favorite [[epithet]]: his most prominent verses of that period are ''The Red Host'', ''The Red Holyday'', ''The Red Hero'', ''The Red Way'', ''The Red Force'' and ''The Red Banner''. In Kazan Cälil worked as copyist in ''Qızıl Tatarstan'' newspaper and studied at [[rabfak]] of the Oriental Pedagogical Institute. He became acquainted with prominent Tatar poets [[Qawi Näcmi]], [[Hadi Taqtaş]], [[Ğädel Qutuy]] and others. Since [[1924]] he is a member of ''October'' literary society, backing [[Proletkult]]. He is published in numerous magazines and newspapers of Kazan. Since [[1924]] his poetry departed from Ghisyanism and aruz, and, probably influenced by Taqtaş, turns to the Tatar folk verse, closer to the European than to the Oriental tradition. His first collection of verses, ''Barabız'' (''We are going'') was published in 1925. The most of those poems are about pre-revolutionary life. <!--The royalties was transferred to the Международный фонд помощи иностранным рабочим--><ref name="mustafin"/>

In 1925-26 Cälil became an instructor of [[Orsk]] [[uyezd]] Komsomol cell, where he visited Tatar and [[Kazakh]] [[aul]]s, agitating for Komsomol there. In 1926 he became the member of Orenburg governorate Komsomol committee. In 1927 Musa moved to [[Moscow]], where he combine his study in the [[Moscow State University]] and job in [[Tatar]]-[[Bashkir]] section of the Central Committee of Komsomol. In 1929 Cälil joined [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The same year his second collection, ''İptäşkä'' (i.e. ''To the Comrade''; [[Jaŋalif]]: ''Iptəşkə'') was published. There were verses, full of optimism and admiration with the future trends. Living in Moscow, Cälil met Russian poets Zharov, Bezymensky, [[Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov|Svetlov]], attend [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s performances. He entered [[Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers]] (МАПП - MAPP), and became its third secretary and a leader of its Tatar section. Now his hero is a village fellow, striving to the new life, admiring with the "voice of machines". Cälil tried to find "new poetic language", full or "proletarian colours". However, in the end of 1920s lyricism appeared in Cälil's poetry.<ref name="mustafin"/>

In 1931 Cälil graduated Literature Faculty of Moscow University. Until 1932 he was a chief editor of ''Keckenə iptəşlər'', later renamed to ''Oktəbr Balasь'' (''[[Little Octobrist]]''), the Tatar magazine for children. Then he headed the section of literature and art in the central Tatar newspaper ''Kommunist''. In 1934 Musa Cälil published two collections. The first of them, ''The Millions, Decorated with Orders'' was devoted mostly to youth and Komsomol, whereas in the second, ''Verses and Poems'', the best of his writing were collected. The mainstream lyric was full of optimism and spirits. However, many of his lyrical poems weren't published, as being in dissonance with [[Stalinism]]. Musa Cälil lived in the various places of the [[USSR]], combining several jobs.<ref name="mustafin"/>

In 1935, the first Russian translations of his poems were published. His verses, set to music, became popular Tatar songs. In 1930s Cälil also translated to the [[Tatar language]] writngs of poets of the [[USSR]] peoples, such as [[Shota Rustaveli]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Pushkin]], [[Nekrasov]], [[Mayakovsky]] and [[Vasily Lebedev-Kumach|Lebedev-Kumach]]. In the late 1930s he tended to write epic poems, such as ''The Director and the Sun'' (1935), ''Cihan'' (1935-1938), ''The Postman'' (1938). A a [[playwright]] of [[Tatar State Opera]] he wrote four librettos for Tatar operas, and the most prominent of them is ''Altınçäç'' (''Golden Hair Maiden'') of [[Näcip Cihanov]].<ref name="mustafin"/> In 1939-1940, he became the chairman of the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers.<ref name="TES">{{TES|Муса Җәлил}}</ref> To this day Musa Cälil is regarded as one of the most significant authors in the [[Tatar language]].

== During World War II ==
[[Image:Calil at war.jpg|thumb|Musa Cälil at war]]
{{main|Cälil's group}}

After [[Nazi Germany]]'s invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Cälil volunteered to the Red Army. Briefly graduating [[Political commissar|political officer]] courses, he arrived to the [[Volkhov Front]] and became [[war correspondent]] in ''Otvaga'' newspaper. Cälil also wrote verse, patriotic but later turns to the ''front lyricism'', i.e. about feelings of war people. 

In June 1942, Cälil's unit was encircled, when they tried to run a blockade he was seriously wounded, shell-shocked and captured. After months in concentration camps for Soviet prisoners-of-war, including [[Stalag-340]] in [[Latvia]]<ref>[http://www.rosculture.ru/milestones/day/show/?id=22958 Федеральное агентство по культуре и кинематографии - Муса Джалиль<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Spandau]], Cälil was transferred to [[Dęblin]], a fortified stronghold in [[Poland]]. There Musa met his fellow countrymen, for the Nazis were assembling prisoners of [[Idel-Ural]] and Eastern nationalities in the camp. He sought out people he could trust in and together they subsequently formed a resistance group. 

In late 1942, the Nazis started forming what they called ''national legions''. Among others, [[Volga Tatar Legion|the Idel-Ural legion]] was formed in [[Jedlina]], Poland, of prisoners-of-war belonging to the nations of the [[Volga]] basin. Since the majority were [[Volga Tatars]], the Germans usually called it the Volga-Tatar legion. The Nazis brainwashed the prisoners in a rabidly [[chauvinist]]ic and [[anti-Soviet]] spirit, to prepare the legionnaires for action against the [[Soviet Army]]. He joined the [[Wehrmacht]] propaganda unit for the legion under the [[Pseudonym|false name]] Gumeroff. [[Cälil's group]] set out to wreck the Nazi plans, to convince the men to use the weapons they would be supplied with against the Nazis themselves. The members of the resistance group infiltrated the editorial board of the ''Idel-Ural'' newspaper the German command produced, and printed and circulated anti-fascist leaflets among the legionnaires into esoteric action groups consisting of 5 men each. The very first battalion of the Volga-Tatar legion that was sent to the [[Eastern front]] mutinied, shot all the German officers, and defected to the [[Soviet partisans]] in [[Belarus]].

In August 1943, Nazi spies managed to track down the resistance group. Musa Cälil and most of his militant comrades were seized. There followed nightmare days and nights of interrogations, torture, and more torture. The [[Gestapo]] broke his left arm and injured his kidneys. His body was covered with welts from the beatings he got with an electric cord and rubber hose. His crushed fingers were swollen and would not bend. But the poet did not give up. Behind bars he continued his fight against [[Nazism]]. He had only his poetry for a weapon.<ref name="kmetyuk"/>

On [[August 10]], [[1943]], he was arrested with his comrades and sent to [[Moabit]] Prison in [[Berlin]]. He sit in cell with [[Belgian]] patriot and resistance fighter [[André Timmermans]], and also with one [[Polish people|Polish]] prisoner. Cälil studied [[German language|German]] in prison to communicate with the cellmates. As the regime was not so harsh, he managed to compile at least hundred of all his verses, composed in the prison, to the small self-made notebooks. He and his group of 12 were sentenced to death on [[February 12]], [[1944]] and guillotined at [[Plötzensee]] Prison, Berlin, on [[August 25]].

{{main|Moabit Notebooks}}
On [[April 23]], [[1945]], the 79th Infantry Corps of the Soviet Army that was advancing on the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] took up positions along the [[Berlin]] streers of Ratenowerstraße and Turnstraße.  A soldier who paused there before the next attack noticed several lines in [[Russian language|Russian]] on one of the clean pages of a book that was lying about: "I am the Tatar poet Musa Cälil, held in Moabit prison as a prisoner-of-war against whom political charges have been preferred, and will most likely be shot soon. If some Russian finds this note, convey my regards to my writer-friends in Moscow and break the news to my family". The soldiers sent the page to Moscow, to the [[Union of Writers]]. That was the first his country heard of the heroic fate of Musa Cälil.<ref name="kmetyuk"/>

Cälil's first notebook was preserved by the Tatars [[Ğabbas Şäripov]] and then [[Niğmät Teregulov]] (both late dead in Stalin's camps). Şäripov also was imprisoned in Moabit and received Cälil's and [[Abdulla Äliş]]'s writings when the prison guards hide of bombing. To preserve the writings, Cälil's group fenced him off.<ref name="qassaf">{{ru icon}} Мусса Джалиль. Моабитские тетради. Татарское книжное издательство. Казань 1963. Составитель - Г. Кашшаф.</ref> The second one was preserved by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] cellmate André Timmermans. Those notebooks were passed to the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers in 1946 and 1947 correspondingly. They were published as two books under the title ''Moabit Däftäre'' (''The Moabit Notebook''). Cälil's widow Äminä Zalyalova gave the originals to the National Museum of [[Tatarstan]] for safekeeping.

It is known that one notebook was brought to the Soviet embassy in [[Rome]] by the ethnically Tatar [[Turkey|Turkish citizen]] Kazim Mirşan in 1946. However, this notebook was lost in the archives of [[SMERSH]], and the pursuits since 1979 give no results. 

== Rehabilitation and recognition ==

All Soviet POVs were considered [[parricide]]s by the USSR authorities. In 1946 [[MGB]] brought an action against Musa Cälil, accusing him of parricide and aiding to the enemy. In April 1947 his name was included to the list of dangerous special criminals. Tatar writers and Tatarstan department of state security managed to prove Cälil's [[Resistance movement|underground]] work against the Nazis and his death. In 1953 ''The Moabit Notebooks'' were published in Kazan<ref name="TES"/> and the Russian translation also was published in ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'' owing to its editor [[Konstantin Simonov]]. Musa Cälil was awarded to the star of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1956 and Literature [[Lenin Prize]] in 1957 for ''The Moabit Notebooks''.

After that Musa Cälil gained recognition as the most heroic Tatar participant of the [[World War II]], despite of being in Nazi prison and his formal participating in the collaborationist legion. The monument to Musa Cälil is placed near the [[Kazan Kremlin]], the museum in his flat was opened in Kazan in 1983.<ref name="TES"/>. His poetry was popularized all over the Soviet Union and the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. As [[Azerbaijani]] poet [[Səməd Vurğun]] wrote,

{{cquote|The world and its literature know many poets who have made their names immortal, but there are few poets who have won immortality both by their unfading works and by the gallant sacrifice of their lives. They are: the great [[Byron]], the renowned poet of the [[Hungarian people]] [[Sándor Petőfi]], the heroic [[Julius Fučík]] and, finally, Musa Cälil.}}

A [[minor planet]] [[3082 Dzhalil]] discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova]] in 1972 is named after him. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?hl=ru&q=3082+Dzhalil Dictionary of Minor Planet Names - p.254]</ref>
